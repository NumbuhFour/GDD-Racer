Possible powerups:

	Stored until used
		Smoke screen (police temporarily lose vision of you, cant get exact position)
		Speed boost: massive speed burst (makes turning hard?)

	Instantly used on pickup
		Repair: heals your car somewhat (restores lost speed from colissions)
	
Missions?
	Move to specific areas while still being chased, linking between areas helps you progress (points?)

City: use a grid system to layout roads, but have not all nodes linked
